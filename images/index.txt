Generally, the extracted images use 3 subchunks of an OPB -- an NCGR, an NCLR, and an NCER, in that order. Some images use an NSCR instead of an NCER, which isn't supported yet. The numbers below indicate which chunks the images are taken from (following the standard order above unless otherwise noted).

The kar subdirectory contains the extracted kar images. It has the following
structure:
  kar/kar         Raw files from KAR.
  kar/kardecmp    KAR images decompressed from RLE8. Note that not all KARs use
                  compression.
  karimg          KAR images converted to editable format. Only stuff that
                  requires editing is present.

The kar files that require editing are:
  kcom/bg.kar               (RLE8)
                            Background graphics for cutscenes.
                            The following require translation:
